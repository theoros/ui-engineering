# UI Engineering


## Useful UI snippets for D3 Angular components and more

Mostly [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [D3](https://d3js.org/) and [ES5](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) code, with a dash of Angular Material.

The HTML files are generated from [Pug](https://pugjs.org) files, which I consider a more comfortable way to _write_ & _read_ HTML, go ahead and compare the two files.
CSS files are generated from [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files, same reasons apply for using it over plain CSS.

Just `git clone` and open `index.html` in your browser to see the components in action.

Versions for the libraries used:

* Angular: 1.5 ([style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md))
* D3: 4
